# Ryu - AI Trading Agents & Position Marketplace on Hyperliquid

Build AI trading agents by prompt. Trade leveraged positions as assets. Positions don't die—they become tradable opportunities.

## About Ryu

Ryu is the first position marketplace built on Hyperliquid L1, introducing three revolutionary features:

### 1. 🤖 AI Agent Builder
Create custom trading strategies using natural language prompts. AI generates complete trading logic, entry/exit rules, and risk management—deployed directly on Hyperliquid perpetual futures.

### 2. 💰 Agent Marketplace
List your AI trading agents for sale. Earn recurring revenue when others subscribe to your strategy. Build reputation, earn royalties on continuation trades, and create passive income from your trading logic.

### 3. 📊 Continuation Trading
The game-changer: When positions hit stop-loss, they don't die—they become tradable assets. Buy leveraged positions others exited at discounts, with full AI reasoning included. Every position can evolve across multiple traders.

## The Innovation

**Stop-loss ≠ Dead Position**  
In traditional trading, a stop-loss means game over. On Ryu, it's just the beginning. Positions become tradable opportunities with embedded AI logic, creating a new asset class: "AI-reasoned leveraged positions."

**Benefits:**
- **For Buyers**: Discounted entries, full AI context, leverage inheritance
- **For Creators**: 5% royalties on continuation profits, reputation building
- **For Platform**: Higher liquidity, longer engagement, natural retention
